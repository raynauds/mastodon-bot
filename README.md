# mastodon-bot
This mostly follows a series of tutorials by Daniel Shiffman (Mastodon Bot & Amazon EC2 Deployment)
In the EC2 Deployed version, there is also a .env file and only the 'application.linux64' folder of the processing sketch. A 'mastodon-bot.pem' file is also required on the computer.

The bot can be found here: https://botsin.space/@chopokopx

It can say something when you follow it.
When mentioned, it can:
 - Answer questions beginning with 'How much' or 'How many'
 - Favorite your toot if it includes nice words (love, cute, cool, kitty, dog, and some others)
 - Make you a drawing if you give 3 numbers in your toot, corresponding to rgb values (e.g. '@chopokopx@botsin.space Please draw me something with 200 red, 50 green, and 150 blue')
