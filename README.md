# mastodon-bot
Made by SÃ©bastien Raynaud in November 2018 @Chopokopx (Twitter) & @kopox@mastodon.social & @chopokopx@botsin.space (Mastodon)
This mostly follows a series of tutorials by Daniel Shiffman: Mastodon Bot & Amazon EC2 Deployment
In the EC2 Deployed version, there is also a .env file and only the 'application.linux64' folder of the processing sketch. A 'mastodon-bot.pem' file is also required on the computer. More information in the links below.

Mastodon of the bot: https://botsin.space/@chopokopx

The bot is made with node.js, uses Mastodon API, and is living in the cloud using Amazon EC2
The bot interacts with people in Mastodon that follow or mention it with certain words
- When followed, toot with a mention to following person
- When mentioned
  - If there is a "?" in the toot
    - If there is "How many" or "How much" in the toot, answer with a mention and some random number
    - Else if there is other keywords like "What" or "When", answer with a mention while saying it doesn't know, it only counts
  - If there is "Thank you", "Thanks", or "Thx" in the toot, answer with a mention and a you're welcome sentence
  - If there are 3 numbers in the toot (ideally between 0 and 255), answer with a mention and a picture generated using the numbers as RGB values
  - If there are nice words like "nice", "kitty", "beautiful", favorite the toot
  
Example:'@chopokopx@botsin.space Please draw me something with 200 red, 50 green, and 150 blue'
